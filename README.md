# CS300

1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   
In the projects for this course, I was tasked with designing and implementing software that could efficiently manage and interact with course data for academic advisors at ABC University. The primary challenge was to create a system that could quickly access, sort, and display course information stored in a structured format. This involved selecting appropriate data structures to manage course data, ensuring the program could handle various operations like searching for a course or listing all courses in an alphanumeric order.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   
To tackle this problem, I first analyzed the requirements to understand which operations would be most frequently performed on the course data. Understanding data structures was vital because the efficiency of these operations—such as insertion, deletion, search, and traversal depended on choosing the right data structure. For instance, I used a Binary Search Tree (BST) because of its advantages in sorted data operations, which was ideal for tasks like printing courses in alphanumeric order and searching for specific courses efficiently.

2. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   
Throughout the project, I encountered several roadblocks, including issues with data parsing and file handling. One significant challenge was ensuring the data loaded correctly and handling malformed data entries gracefully. I overcame these challenges by implementing good error checking and validation before inserting data into the data structure. Debugging played a crucial role, as did unit testing different parts of the application to ensure each module functioned as expected before integrating them.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   
This project has significantly broadened my perspective on software design, especially the importance of choosing appropriate data structures based on the specific needs of the application. It emphasized that understanding the trade-offs between different data structures can lead to more efficient and effective software solutions. Additionally, it reinforced the value of modular design and abstraction, allowing me to build reusable components and clearer, more maintainable code.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
The project has refined my coding practices towards writing more maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs. I focused on writing clean code with clear naming conventions and comprehensive commenting, which aids future modifications and debugging. Implementing modular functions and adhering to the principles of object-oriented design also enhanced the adaptability of the software, allowing for easier updates and expansions of the program’s capabilities without extensive rewrites.
